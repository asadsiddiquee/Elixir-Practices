# Elixir Practice 

### Short Story
Hello there, I'm Asad Siddiquee. After gaining little proficiency in HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React, Next.js, and Gatsby, I've made the decision to explore backend development. As a result, I've embarked on my journey with Node.js. 

As i was studying about NodeJS's Architecture (Event Loop), it amazed me and i was wondering maybe there is something better. Then I found ***Elixir***. After a few days of research i told myself "This is it!".

### About This repo

As a part-time coder, I face the challenge of maintaining consistency and dealing with long gaps between my coding practices. Unfortunately, this often leads to a loss of retention, with only a small percentage of what I've previously practiced being retained.

So the ***First Goal*** of this Repo is to Practice minimum 100 Exercises on Elixir. 

***Second***, this repo will refresh my memory even if i comeback to practice Elixir after a gap.

***Third***, This repo will be public and people will see what i have been upto. It will also create an accountability in me.

***Fourth***, it will give me boost and motivation about my progress.
 

***After Completition of minimum 100 Elixir Exercises i will create another repo for Phoenix Practices. Then, I will continue practising in both repo***
